Add option to set another notification once one has been submitted.


Save subscriptions in db (e.g. mongo) and retreive them. Best done as a promise, see this page 
https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/sending-messages-with-web-push-libraries

  return getSubscriptionsFromDatabase()
  .then(function(subscriptions) {
    let promiseChain = Promise.resolve();

    for (let i = 0; i < subscriptions.length; i++) {
      const subscription = subscriptions[i];
      promiseChain = promiseChain.then(() => {
        return triggerPushMsg(subscription, dataToSend);
      });
    }

    return promiseChain;
  })

I think sometimes there is faulty logic causing price targets to become switched. E.g. low targets becoming high targets and showing the wrong notification. Could be the form submitting and sending the wrong operator. Or maybe the logic on the server.
